# React Password Generator
I've created a random password generator using React.

I'm currently taking Luiz Otávio Miranda Figueiredo course called Curso de JavaScript e TypeScript do básico ao avançado 2021 (Javascript and TypeScript course from basics to advanced level).

Then, after the JS part of the course, he made the js code for the password generator as an activity/projec. I've changed some things regarding the logic, such as the order of the characters: while in his activity, he showed how to generate the password following -> uppercase letter -> lowercase letter -> number -> symbol, I've added in my version the method for getting the characters randomly.

Also, I've decided to make style using styled components with React.
Moreover, I know the design is pretty simple, but I've made it myself.
